# ⚡ Power Grid Rerouting GUI

A Python-based Tkinter GUI application for simulating and visualizing power grid rerouting using Dijkstra's algorithm. It enables dynamic fault handling and real-time graph visualization with rerouting functionality.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Load power grid from a file (`data.txt`)
- Display the network of grids and connections
- Mark faulty grids (nodes)
- Suggest rerouting paths around faulty grids
- Compute shortest path using Dijkstra’s algorithm (avoids faulty nodes)
- Real-time graphical visualization using NetworkX and Matplotlib

---

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**: For shortest path calculation avoiding faulty nodes
- **Tkinter GUI**: For user interaction
- **NetworkX + Matplotlib**: For graph visualization
