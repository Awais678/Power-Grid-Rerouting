# ‚ö° Power Grid Rerouting GUI

A Python-based Tkinter GUI application for simulating and visualizing power grid rerouting using Dijkstra's algorithm. It enables dynamic fault handling and real-time graph visualization with rerouting functionality.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Load power grid from a file (`data.txt`)
- Display the network of grids and connections
- Mark faulty grids (nodes)
- Suggest rerouting paths around faulty grids
- Compute shortest path using Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm (avoids faulty nodes)
- Real-time graphical visualization using NetworkX and Matplotlib

---

## üß† Algorithms Used

- **Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm**: For shortest path calculation avoiding faulty nodes
- **Tkinter GUI**: For user interaction
- **NetworkX + Matplotlib**: For graph visualization

## üóÇÔ∏è File Structure

- `power_grid_rerouting.py` - Main GUI application
- - `mainCode.cpp - Main Code in cpp
- `data.txt` - Input graph data (sample provided)
- `README.md` - Project documentation

## üìù Sample `data.txt`

0 1 15
0 2 20
1 3 25
2 3 30

The first line 13 15 means:
13: Total number of nodes (or grids) in the power grid (numbered from 0 to 12).
15: This is likely outdated or misleading ‚Äî there are actually 22 edges in the file. The program doesn't strictly rely on this number; it just reads all edges from the subsequent lines.

Each subsequent line (e.g., 0 1 15) represents an undirected edge:
0: Source grid (node)
1: Destination grid (node)
15: Weight (e.g., cost, distance, power loss, or any metric relevant to grid connection)

So, 0 1 15 means:
Grid 0 is connected to Grid 1 with a weight of 15.


‚úÖ STEP-BY-STEP WORKING

1. GUI Initialization (Tkinter)
When you run the script:
‚Ä¢	A Tkinter GUI window opens.
‚Ä¢	It displays:
      ‚Ä¢   Buttons: Load Graph, Display Power Grid, Mark grid Faulty, Reroute Around Faulty Grid, Dijkstra's Rerouting, Exit
	  ‚Ä¢   Entry boxes for:
           ‚Ä¢   Source Grid
	       ‚Ä¢   Destination Grid
	       ‚Ä¢   Faulty Grids (comma-separated)
